                <p class="gift-text" >Hello everyone! 
                    
                        First off, we'd like to say that your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift
                    we could ask for. The time, effort, and expense of traveling to be with us is something
                    we deeply appreciate, and we are so thrilled that we'll be able to celebrate with you.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you'd like to give us a gift we have been blessed to already have a lot of the "essential" home items a newly married
                    couple needs and because of this we don't need any appliances or new home items. 
                    Therefore, we would greatly appreciate any donations that we will be using to make our  
                    perfect honeymoon
                    come true!</p>

                    <p>The memories from this honeymoon will last a lot
                    longer than a new set of glasses (especially at our breakage rate!)
                    so feel free to write a check, put some cash in a card, or just show up because your
                    presence is also a gift.</p>

                    <p class="gift-text-two">This background image is the exact mountain peak that we plan
                        on climbing on our honeymoon, it is the tallest peak in Arizona 
                        at 12,637 ft or 3,851 meters. We'll also be seeing the Grand Canyon, and
                         Sedona.
