# weddingSite
I created this site without using a library like React even though it would probably be cleaner for a specific reason. I did this I could practice building 
something from scratch without and help. 
I also wrote all the css without using any help. This site is the rsvp site for my wedding. 
you  can view it at davidplusryan.com
I chose to have the form input data sent to a google sheet and saved there. I wrote a script that takes the data and stores it in columns and rows. 
The reasoning behind using this instead of using mongodb or sql was that google sheets
is a lot easier to share with my finance so she can view it. 
the website is fully responsive and I wrote the css to be mobile friendly first and change the location of the nav bar using css grid to the left side
on desktop whereas it is at the top on mobile phones.
