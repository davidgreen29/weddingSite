# weddingSite
you can view this site at davidplusryan.com

This is a site where guests can find info for my wedding and rsvp to it. 




navigation

html/pages/folder

inside the pages folder you can find all the pages for the site. index.html is outside this folder because it works
better with netlify. 

styles

inside the styles folder you can find all the styles besides the main page styles which is located in index.css

scripts 

inside the scripts folder you can find the nav element script,form script, contact script

form script 
 javascript to handle the user input data which
is sent to google sheets and stored there. I chose this because it is easy for my finance to view on google sheets. 

contact script
this allows the user to open and close the contact data. 

For this site a framework like react for the front end would have been cleaner but I used plain html, css, and javascript because I wanted to refresh my skills on those. I used plain CSS and no libraries because I wanted the 
design to be completely custom. This also is good practice for CSS. The site is fully responsive and works for
mobile screens also.
